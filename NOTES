I'll need to look at it again and write down my thoughts, will do so this
week after work some evening.  One thing I do remember seeing was a function
doing swap on PTEs for MIPS didn't seem to be atomic, I have concerns about
concurrent fault with multithreaded processes on that one.  The stats
(wired_count etc) aren't updated atomically.  I'm concerned about ordering
of PV entry ops with regard to PTE insertions but it's probably not an issue
for us just yet given the way the locking works in UVM.
