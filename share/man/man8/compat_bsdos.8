.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_bsdos
.Nd binary compatibility for BSDi releases
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Dv COMPAT_NOMID
kernel option includes compatibility with
.Tn BSDi Ns No \ 1. Ns Em \^x Ns \|\(en\|3. Ns Em \^x
.Xr a.out 5
binaries on
.Nx Ns Tn /i386
and
.Nx Ns Tn /amd64 .
The option is enabled by default in the
.Li GENERIC
kernel on i386,
but needs to be set along with
.Dv EXEC_AOUT
on amd64.
.Pp
Null memory protection must be disabled with the
.Xr sysctl 7
option
.Va vm.user_va0_disable
set to
.Li 0
for the binaries to run successfully.
.Pp
.Bsx 2.0+
binaries also require an
.Xr ldconfig 8
configuration or a symbolic link
pointing to the
.Pa /emul/bsdos/shlib
directory to run outside of a chroot.
.Pp
.Bsx 4.0
switched to an ELF binary executable format
that does not run under the
compatibility layers currently available on
.Nx .

.Sh HISTORY
.Tn BSD/386 Ns No \ 1.0\|\(en\|1.1
was derived from
.Bx 4.3 Tn Reno
code in the
.Tn Net/2
release.
.Pp
.Bsx 2.0
was based on
.Bx 4.4 Tn Lite ,
but introduced new static shared libraries
compiled into binary objects under
.Pa /shlib .
The build system included the
.Li shlicc
command with the
.Fl Bstatic
flag that allowed reverting to the standard
library archive format.
.Pp
.Ox 2.2\|\(en\|4.7
included a different compatibility implementation
under the
.Dv COMPAT_BSDOS
kernel option.
.Sh BUGS
.Bsx
compatibility was broken on
.Nx 5\|\(en\|6
.Pp
.Bsx 3.0
added
.Tn SPARC
support, but the binaries are incorrectly recognized as
.Tn SunOS
executables and fail on
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc
and
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64 .
