# $NetBSD: addch,v 1.7 2021/02/14 11:21:37 rillig Exp $
#
# Between at least 2012 and 2016, addstr did not advance win->curx for a '\t',
# but addch did.  This was inconsistent.
#
# On 2016.11.28.18.25.26 on NetBSD 7.99.43, this inconsistency was fixed.
# Now both functions advanced win->curx.
#
# On 2019.05.20.22.17.41 on NetBSD 8.99.41, the fix was modified, which
# introduced another inconsistency.  Since then, addstr advanced win->curx as
# expected, but addch advanced it by twice the amount.
#
# On 2021.02.13.14.30.37 on NetBSD 9.99.80, this inconsistency was fixed.
# Now both functions advanced win->curx again.
