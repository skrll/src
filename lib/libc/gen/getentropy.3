.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getentropy "void *buf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getentropy
function fills a buffer with high quality random data, suitable for seeding
cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators.
.Pp
.Fn getentropy
is only intended for seeding random number generators and is not intended
for use by regular code which simply needs secure random data.
For this purpose, please use
.Xr arc4random 3 .
.Pp
The maximum value for
.Li buflen
is 256 bytes.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fn getentropy
reads from the
.Xr sysctl 7
variable
.Li kern.arandom .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getentropy
function returns 0 on success, and \-1 if an error occurred.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getentropy
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
