.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ossaudio
.Nd Open Sound System emulation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libossaudio
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In soundcard.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an emulation of the Open Sound System audio interface.
.Pp
Use the native
.Xr audio 4
and
.Xr mixer 4
interfaces for new programs, and this emulation library only for
building code written for other operating systems.
.Ss Mixer Control Map
The following table summarizes the mappings from native interface
device names to OSS mixer controls.
.Pp
.Bl -column ".Sy Native Device Name" "SOUND_MIXER_SPEAKER"
.It Sy "Native Device Name" Ta Sy "OSS Mixer Control"
.It *.mic Ta SOUND_MIXER_MIC
.It *.line Ta SOUND_MIXER_LINE
.It *.cd Ta SOUND_MIXER_CD
.It *.dac Ta SOUND_MIXER_PCM

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
interface aims to be compatible with the Open Sound System version 4, as
described in:
.Pp
.Rs
.%A 4Front Technologies
.%T OSS 4.x Programmer's Guide 
.%U http://manuals.opensound.com/developer/
.%D 2007
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr mixer 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Pp
The Open Sound System up to version 3 was originally the preferred
API for writing audio code under Linux until ALSA became the new default
in Linux 2.6.
It remains the preferred API in FreeBSD and Solaris, and a large body
of code exists supporting it.
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
The emulation is incomplete.
Some obscure features are not included, but the essential ioctls used
by the majority of software are covered.
.Pp
The emulation uses a #define for
.Fn ioctl
so some obscure programs
can fail to compile.
.Pp
Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris provide
.Pa /dev/dsp
and
.Pa /dev/mixer
devices in place of the
.Pa /dev/audio
and
.Pa /dev/mixer
devices this compatibility layer must be accessed through on NetBSD.
However, changing this is typically trivial when porting programs.
.Pp
The emulation only covers
.Fn ioctl ,
there are other differences as well.
E.g., on a write
that would block in non-blocking mode Linux returns
.Dv EINTR
whereas
.Nx 1.3
returns
.Dv EAGAIN .
