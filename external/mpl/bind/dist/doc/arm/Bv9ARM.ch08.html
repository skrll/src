    BIND 9.16 is a stable branch of BIND.
    This document summarizes significant changes since the last
    production release on that branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.
  </p>

  <div class="section">

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
    release numbering convention.  BIND 9.16 contains new features added
    during the BIND 9.15 development process. Henceforth, the 9.16 branch
    will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
    in the unstable 9.17 branch.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code class="filename">libuv</code> asynchronous I/O library and the
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead of OpenSSL for
    Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation),
    but OpenSSL is still required for general cryptography operations
    such as hashing and random number generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORMS.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
    should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
  </p>

          BIND crashes on startup when linked against libuv 1.36. This issue is
          related to recvmmsg() support in libuv which was first included in
          libuv 1.35. The problem was addressed in libuv 1.37, but the relevant
          libuv code change requires a special flag to be set during library
          initialization in order for recvmmsg() support to be enabled. This
          BIND release sets that special flag when required, so recvmmsg()
          support is now enabled when BIND is compiled against either libuv 1.35
          or libuv &gt;= 1.37; libuv 1.36 is still not usable with BIND. [GL #1761]

          We have received reports that in some circumstances, receipt of an
          IXFR can cause the processing of queries to slow significantly. Some
          of these were related to RPZ processing, which has been fixed in this
          release (see below). Others appear to occur where there are
          NSEC3-related changes (such as an operator changing the NSEC3 salt
          used in the hash calculation). These are being investigated.

          These allow the use of trust anchors in DS format instead of
          DNSKEY format.  DS format allows trust anchors to be configured
          for keys that have not yet been published; this is the format
          used by IANA when announcing future root keys.

          configures a dynamic trust anchor to be maintained via RFC 5011, and
          <span class="command"><strong>static-ds</strong></span> configures a permanent trust anchor.
